# Hephzibah Behulah — Cyber Systems Lab

A static GitHub Pages portfolio presented as an interactive horizontal OSINT-style systems map.

## Navigation

The tree is the navigation. The primary branches are:

- ABOUT — profile, timeline, engineering, cybersecurity, data and philosophy
- WORK — Elektroniker, aviation systems, web development, data analytics, research and technology stack
- LAB — reconnaissance, web security, security testing, network/OSINT, training labs, ethical tool terminal and Kali/WSL2 toolkit
- PROJECTS — pentest toolkit, data analytics, secure web, systems monitor, security blog and GitHub repositories
- PORTFOLIO — skill matrix, hosting/deployment and Python compiler
- KNOWLEDGE — fundamentals, cyber learning, data learning, quizzes/games, resources and study notes
- CONTACT — email, GitHub, LinkedIn, blog, GitBook and public social channels

## Interactive features

### Horizontal tree
D3 renders the navigation as a horizontal relationship tree. Children grow to the right. Drag to pan, scroll to zoom, Fit to center, and click a node to expand/collapse or inspect it.

### Ethical Tool Terminal
The site includes a browser-safe terminal containing 50+ named tools and utilities, including Nmap, Masscan, Rustscan, Amass, Gobuster, ffuf, Nuclei, Burp Suite, Metasploit, SQLmap, Hydra, Hashcat, Wireshark, Shodan and more.

The terminal is functional as an educational simulator: commands are parsed, tools can be selected or searched, and deterministic synthetic output is displayed. It does not perform real scans, credential attacks, DNS queries or network traffic from a visitor's browser.

### Cyber Defender Quiz
The KNOWLEDGE → QUIZZES / GAMES node launches an interactive cybersecurity quiz with scoring and replay. Topics include OSI/networking, HTTP, MFA, authentication, DNS, phishing and Linux.

### Python Compiler
PORTFOLIO → PYTHON COMPILER links to OneCompiler for Python demonstrations.
